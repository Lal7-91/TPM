# ✈️ Travel Plan Mate

## 🧩 Overview
The **Travel Plan Mate** is a software engineering project designed to simplify travel planning by integrating live data from multiple APIs.  
Our system helps users find the best **flights, hotels, and attractions** using:
- **SerpAPI** for fetching Google Flights, Hotels, and TripAdvisor data  
- **Anthropic API** for data analysis and intelligent recommendations  
- **Streamlit** for building an interactive and user-friendly interface  

This project serves as an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) demonstrating how AI and API integration can automate and enhance travel decision-making.
